# The Pet Store üêà

## Setup Environment

1. This workshop was written in node `11.14.0`. While it should be compatible with later versions of node, if you do have any issues it is worth installing this version specifically. If you have Node Version Manager (NVM) installed you can use the command `nvm use` to switch to this version. If you don't have `11.14.0` installed it will prompt you to install it with the command `nvm install 11.14.0`.

2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into a new file `.env` in the root directory. **The tests will not pass unless you do this.**
   This configures the app to point to the API service URL.

### ‚ö†Ô∏èüö® Please do not use npm. We used yarn while building the project, and while testing it with npm we found issues during installation. Please use yarn instead of npm üö®‚ö†Ô∏è
