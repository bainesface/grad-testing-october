# Business case

We want to ensure that we collect valid email addresses so that we can contact our subscribers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The submit button should be disabled until a valid email address is detected in the input field.

## Hints

- You would want a sensible number of invalid emails to assert against to prove that the validation picks up invalid emails.
- It's not feasible to test every possible input, what we're looking for is a reasonable level of confidence that the feature works.
